# DEEP LEARNING - MAI371

## Course Description

Welcome to the repository for the MAI371 - Deep Learning. This repository serves as a central hub for storing all course-related materials, including lecture notes, lab exercises, assessments, and additional resources.

### Course Overview

- **Total Teaching Hours For Semester:** 75
- **Number of Lecture Hours/Week:** 7
- **Max Marks:** 150
- **Credits:** 4

#### Course Objectives:

The main objective of this course is to make students comfortable with the tools and techniques required to handle large datasets. Several libraries and datasets publicly available will be used to illustrate the application of these algorithms. This will help students develop the skills required to gain experience of doing independent research and study.

#### Course Outcomes:

1. Recognize the basic concepts and techniques of deep learning.
2. Evaluate and prepare to apply deep learning algorithms.
3. Apply deep learning models for applications.
4. Identify appropriate tools to implement the solutions to problems related to deep learning.
